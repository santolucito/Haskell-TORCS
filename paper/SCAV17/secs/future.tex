\section{Conclusions}

We have presented a library to write autonomous vehicle controllers in FRP that supports cross-vehicle communication.
This work opens the door for further research in using the powerful FRP paradigm for building safer, more reliable controllers for one of the most critical applications in reactive systems.

%Although FRP supports both handling of continuous and discrete behaviors, we have treated all data as continuous.
%For example, we have chosen to implement the communications protocol as continuous, though it would be interesting to explore the implications of a discrete model
%Additionally, FRP may particularly well-suited to be used in a human-in-the-loop setting, where discrete user actions must be considered in addition to sensor data.
