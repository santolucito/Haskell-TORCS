\title{Verifying Neural Networks against Spoofing Attacks with Hybrid Automata Reachability}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{4} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}

Machine learning has been leveraged to great effect in the construction of efficient and performant cyber physical systems.
However, this has introduced the problem of legibility - it is hard to make formal arguments about the behavior of learned systems.
We propose an approach to structured machine learning by leveraging program synthesis.
We synthesis automata from temporal logic specifications, and use the automata as a combination strategy for many smaller neural networks.
We provide a measure of the attack surface of a neural network, and demonstrate that our approach results in safer systems.
As a case study, we run simulate an sensor spoofing attack in a vehicle simulator and measure the time to recovery for our system and a typical monolithic controller.
