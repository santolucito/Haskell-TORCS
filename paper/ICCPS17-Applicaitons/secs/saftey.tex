\section{Saftey}

In this section, building off the definition provided in~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HuangKWW16}, we provide a formal definition of the vulnerability to advererial input of a mealy machine where the transition actions are neural networks.
We then show how by decomposing a larger neural network into an automata of smaller neural networks, we can reduce the overall vulnerability of the system.
Relying on the structure of the automata connecting the network, we can provide formal proofs activation periods of each individual network and demonstrate that adversarial inputs are less likely to be acted upon within a given time frame.
