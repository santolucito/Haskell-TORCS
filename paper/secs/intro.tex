\section{Introduction}

Autonomous vehicles are considered to be one of the most challenging
types of reactive systems currently under development. They need to
interact with a highly reactive environment. Life critical decisions
have to be made instantaneously and need to be executed at the right
point in time. However, even if the intricate task of designing such
systems is conquered, it still needs to be ensured, that the result is
also safe and reliable.



\begin{itemize}

\item explain the rise of functional programming languages, and that 
types provide intuitive reasoning about safety

\item explain that functional languages now also are used for hardware
  (embedded systems people probably don't know about that) (mention
  results like \emph{clash} or \emph{Kansas Lava})

\item for reactive systems, a proper notion of time is necessary,
  motivate on some example (synchronous vs asynchronous, real vs
  discrete), finally lead to FRP

\item motivate FRP (this is the most important part, almost sure that
  nobody of the reviews will know about; go through the very basics,
  remember these are embedded systems people)

\item we provide first example of using FRP to control autonomous
  vehicle, our approach is elegant and simple, which makes it
  resistant against errors. Furthermore it is easily extendable
  without breaking the remaining system.

\end{itemize}
