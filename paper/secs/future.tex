\section{Future Work}

Although FRP supports both handling of continuous and discrete behaviors, we have only addressed continuous data processing.
Furthermore, FRP is be well-suited to be used in a human-in-the-loop setting, where discrete user actions must be considered in addition to sensor data. Both areas provide a huge surface for further explorations.
