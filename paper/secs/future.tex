\section{Conclusions}

We have presented a library to write autonomous vehicle controllers in FRP that supports cross-vehicle communication.
This opens the door for further research into using the powerful FRP model for  

%Although FRP supports both handling of continuous and discrete behaviors, we have treated all data as continuous.
%For example, we have chosen to implement the communications protocol as continuous, though it would be interesting to explore the implications of a discrete model
%Additionally, FRP may particularly well-suited to be used in a human-in-the-loop setting, where discrete user actions must be considered in addition to sensor data.
