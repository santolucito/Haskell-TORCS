\section{Future Work}

Although the existing tool is a fully featured vehicle simulator for FRP, it is specifically tailored to the FRP library Yampa.
Minor modifications should allow the tool to easily work with other libraries.
It may also be intersting to build more lower level binding to allow non-FRP Haskell program to interface with TORCS.
While FRP is one of the simpiliest interfaces for reactive systems programming in functional languages, it is also possible to use functional language in this context without FRP.
