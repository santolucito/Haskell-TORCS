\section{Future Work}

Although FRP supports both handling of continuous and discrete behaviors, we have only addressed continuous data processing here.
In principle, FRP should be well-suited in be used in a human-in-the-loop setting, where discrete user actions must be considered in addition to sensor data.

Additionally, the issue of platooning is as yet unexplored by FRP approaches.
Communication between asynchronous FRP processes has been explored to some degree~\cite{danwcAsync,HudakQSW15} but the additional motivation of applying such strategies to vehicles platooning could be a boon for both fields of research.
This platform can open the door for further investigation and development in this area.
