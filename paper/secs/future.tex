\section{Conclusisons and Future Work}

We have presented a library to 

Although FRP supports both handling of continuous and discrete behaviors, we have treated all data as continuous.
For example, we have chosen to implement the communications protocol as continuous, though it would be interesting to explore the implications of a discrete model
Additionally, FRP may particularly well-suited to be used in a human-in-the-loop setting, where discrete user actions must be considered in addition to sensor data.
