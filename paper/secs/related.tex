\section{Related Work}

TORCS was used by ~\cite{kamali2016formal} as a simulator for formal verification of platoons.

There has been demonstrated interest in using Haskell for safer autonomous vehicles ~\cite{pike2014}.
They highlight the benefits of a type-safe, functional language to avoid programming errors.

FRP specifically has been proposed as a tool for vehicle control~\cite{kazemi2016,zou2016}.
This work extends FRP to also prioritize certain functions for timing constraints.
This has been not yet been tested on vehicle simulation, no doubt in part due to the lack of a simulator compatible with Haskell.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first FRP-based vehicle simulator.
Although there are many bindings to various vehicle simulators, these tend to use imperative languages.
For instance, TORCS allows users to direct edit the package and add a new car in C++.
There are also a few TORCS bindings for python, which have been notably used in the TORCS competition.
