\subsection{Mixture of Experts}

From a machine learning perspective, we can view this architecture as an instance of the mixture of experts architecture.
In this case, the Mealy machine acts as the \textit{Gating Network} in Fig.~\ref{fig:MOE}.
By using an explicit structure for the gating networks (as opposed to another neural network), we enable a level of legibility over the entire system.

\subsection{Legibility of NNs}
There are multiple existing definitions of safety for neural networks.
However, none of the existing works provide a framework for evaluating the safety of multiple connected neural networks.

\subsection{Program Synthesis}
Correct by construction
