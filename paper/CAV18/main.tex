\begin{abstract}

Neural networks have been leveraged to great effect in the construction of efficient and performant cyber physical systems.
However, this has introduced a problem of legibility - it is difficult to make formal arguments about the behavior of learned systems.
We propose an approach to structured machine learning by leveraging program synthesis.
We synthesize automata from temporal logic specifications, and use the automata as a combination strategy for many smaller neural networks.
We provide a measure of the attack surface of a neural network, and demonstrate that our approach results in safer systems.
As a case study, we run simulate an sensor spoofing attack in a vehicle simulator and measure the time to recovery for our system and a typical monolithic controller.
